The class files have been deleted and when you pull this branch you will not be able to run the java files.
In eclipse, right-click your project and refresh it. After that, go to project in the top menu of the eclipse and then clean and select the project. 
After this, run as a Java application and it should work. Also, make sure build automatically is on after that.
